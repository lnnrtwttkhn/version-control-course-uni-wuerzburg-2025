We are excited that you have signed up for this course and can‚Äôt wait to explore the world of version control with you!\nIn preparation for the course, we kindly ask you to complete two assignments: (1) check if you have Git installed, and (2) answer a survey. In total, this should take about 20 to 30 minutes (not much longer).\n1. Check Git Installation\nPlease check if you have Git installed. You can find detailed instructions in our online course book here: https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/installation.html. Windows users: Please install Git for Windows (https://gitforwindows.org). macOS and Linux users: You likely have Git already installed. Open the Terminal / Command Line and enter the command git --version. If a version number is shown, Git is installed. For more details, see the link to the online course book above. If you have any questions about the installation process, don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us. And please don‚Äôt forget to bring your laptop, with Git installed, to the course!\n2. Complete Survey\nIn order to tailor the course to your prior experience and needs, we have prepared a survey with a few questions. Please complete the survey before the course, ideally at least two days before the course starts. This will give us enough time to review your responses before our first session.\nThe survey can be accessed here: https://version-control-intro.formr.org.\nA few technical remarks about the survey: The survey will ask you for two codewords: a personal codeword and a course codeword.\nThe personal codeword is used to associate your responses with a unique identifier. This will allow us to identify and relate your responses across all surveys used in the course while ensuring anonymity. By providing a personal codeword, you will allow us to draw more detailed insights from your responses that will help us improve the course for you. The survey will contain an explanation at the beginning on how to generate your personal codeword.\nThe course codeword is used to tag your responses as coming from a course participant at Julius-Maximilians-Universit√§t W√ºrzburg, Research Training Group 2660: Approach-Avoidance. We might also use the survey to collect responses from participants in other course settings. The course codeword therefore allows us to distinguish responses from different course settings.\nThe course codeword is: -------- (course password will be announced during the course).\nPlease note that you might be asked for the codewords repeatedly. This is not an error in the survey but the result of combining separate smaller surveys into a longer one. If this happens, please just enter the personal and course codeword again.\nFurther information about the course can be found on our course website at https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uni-wuerzburg-2025/.\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact us directly via email.\nWe are looking forward to seeing you at the course!\nBest wishes,\nLennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) and the organizing team"

We ask all participants to comply to the instructions of the speaker with regard to dedicated discussion space and time.\nParticipants should not take pictures of any activity in the course room without asking all involved participants for consent and receiving this consent.\n\nA first violation of this code of conduct will result in a warning, and subsequent violations by the same person can result in the immediate removal from the course without further warning. The organizers also reserve the right to prohibit attendance of excluded participants from similar future workshops, courses or meetings they organize."

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\n\nContent\nIn today‚Äôs digital age, the majority of scientific insights in research are gained from the analysis of data using programming code. Although data and code are integral parts of their work, scientists often handle digital objects on their computers in a somewhat chaotic, unreliable, and irreproducible manner. It‚Äôs not uncommon to hear researchers wondering, ‚ÄúWhich version of my data and code did I use to get this result?‚Äù or ‚ÄúI found a bug in my code. Since when was it there?‚Äù and ‚ÄúThis code used to work! What did I change?‚Äù. This not only affects the reproducibility and trustworthiness of science but also frequently leads to frustration, a waste of time, and, at worst, the loss of painstakingly accumulated work. The good news is that scientists can learn about practices and tools from other disciplines, particularly software engineering, that have significantly professionalized collaborative work on digital objects like programming code. At the core of this toolkit is the free and open-source software Git, a so-called version control system that allows tracking and organizing the evolution of digital objects on computers and sharing them via platforms like GitHub. In this hands-on course with practical exercises, participants will learn how to track, organize and share their work using Git.\n\n\nGoals\nThe primary aim of this course is to empower course participants with the skills to efficiently organize projects on their computers using Git and GitHub. Participants will actively engage in hands-on experiences with these tools, exploring both the command-line and Graphical User Interfaces. Proficiency in Git and GitHub not only enhances participants‚Äô effectiveness in conducting research projects by ensuring organized and reproducible workflows but also elevates their employability. The technical skills acquired in this course are increasingly sought after in various work settings, providing course participants with a competitive edge in today‚Äôs dynamic job market.\n\n\nMechanics\nGuided by the seminar instructor, participants will engaging in practical hands-on exercises with Git and GitHub while working through a dedicated Git Handbook (https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/) that is tuned to the structure of the course and needs of the course participants."

Thank you very much for your participation!\nWith this email, we would kindly ask you for your feedback. Your valuable feedback will help us improve future versions of this course but also other courses on related topics. We have prepared an online survey that should not take much longer than up to 15 minutes to complete.\nThe feedback survey can be accessed here: https://version-control-feedback.formr.org/.\nPlease use the same personal and course codeword as before, which allows us to associate your responses with the specific course that you took part in. As a reminder, the course codeword is -------- (course password will be announced during the course). Thank you very much for your feedback!\nThe course materials will continue to be available on the course website at https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uni-wuerzburg-2025/. We will also continue the development on the ‚ÄúVersion Control Book‚Äù available at https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book. Feel free to take a look at it again at any later point of your Git journey.\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact us directly via email.\nThank you again for your participation and feedback!\nBest wishes,\nLennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) and the organizing team"
