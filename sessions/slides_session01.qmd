### Research is reproducible ...

*"... when the **same analysis** steps performed on the **same dataset** consistently produce the **same answer**."* ^[@turingway2022, see ["Guide on Reproducible Research"](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions)]

- In short: Someone else can run your analysis *on their computer* and gets the same results
- Reproducibility as a minimal requirement for research?

## Current state of reproducibility in (psychological) research

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### @artner2021

- Analyzed 46 articles from three APA journals in 2012.
- Extracted 232 statistical claims from these papers.
- Successfully reproduced 163 statistical results (70%).
- Focus: Reproducibility of individual statistical claims.
:::
::: {.fragment}
### @hardwicke2021

- Analyzed 25 articles published in *Psychological Science* (2014–2015) with Open Data Badges.
- 15 articles (60%) were fully reproducible.
- 9 out of these 15 (60%) were reproducible without author involvement.
- Focus: Study-level reproducibility.
:::
::::
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### @crüwell2023

- Investigated 14 articles from a more recent issue of *Psychological Science*.
- Only 1 out of 14 articles was exactly reproducible.
- 3 additional articles were essentially reproducible with minor deviations.
- All articles had Open Data Badges.
:::
::: {.fragment}

### @obels2020

- Analyzed 62 registered reports in Psychology (2014-18).
- 36 reports (58%) shared both data and code.
- Of those, 21 (58%) were found to be reproducible.
- Focus: Impact of open science practices on reproducibility.

*"... when the **same analysis** steps performed on the **same dataset** consistently produce the **same answer**."* ^[@turingway2022, see ["Guide on Reproducible Research"](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions)]

:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### The problem
:::
::: {.incremental}
- about **more than half** of research is **not reproducible** [^1]
  - research data, code, software & materials are **often not available** "upon *reasonable* [sic] request"
  - if resources are shared, they are **often incomplete**
- 90% of researchers: "reproducibility crisis" (*N* = 1576) ^[see @baker2016, *Nature*]

:::
::: {.fragment}
### Why?
:::
::: {.incremental}
- computational reproducibility is hard
- researchers lack training 
- incentives are not (yet) aligned ^[see e.g., @poldrack2019]
- *more ...*

"*... accumulated evidence indicates [...] **substantial room for improvement** with regard to research practices to maximize the efficiency of the research community's use of the public's financial investment.*" [@munafò2017]
:::
::: {.fragment}
We need a **professional toolkit** for digital research!
:::

[^1]: for example, in Psychology: @crüwell2023; @hardwicke2021; @obels2020; @wicherts2006


::: {.notes}
- also called "analytical reproducibility"
- in contrast: "Replication" = same analysis on different data
- computational reproducibility should be a *minimum* requirement
- 90% of respondents to a survey in Nature agreed that there is a "reproducibility crisis"
- non-scientist friends react very surprised at the lack of professionalization in science
- we are currently violating the public's trust = deep ethical problem
- natural selection: as a researcher, what's good for your career is not necessarily good for science (how to get funding, how to get published, how to get cited)
- journals are interested in selling us back our data, not improving the quality of science
:::

## What about Open Science?

Open science is an umbrella term for **activities that aim to promote open approaches to science and research**.

#### The long-term challenges are non-technical
- open-source, avoiding commercial vendor lock-in
- adopting new practices and upgrading workflows
- moving towards a "culture of reproducibility" ^[see ["Towards a culture of computational reproducibility"](https://mediasite.video.ufl.edu/Mediasite/Play/b26b123b082e4adba367b8f2b91ce34a1d) by Russ Poldrack, Stanford University]
- changing incentives, policies & funding schemes

#### Technical solutions already exist!
- **Version control** of digital research outputs (e.g., [Git](https://gitlab.com/), [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/))
- Integration with **flexible infrastructure** (e.g., [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/))
- Systematic **contributions** & review (e.g., [pull](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)/[merge](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/) requests)
- **Automated integration** & deployment (e.g., [CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/))
- Reproducible **computational environments** (e.g., [Docker](https://www.docker.com/))
- Transparent **execution** and **build** systems (e.g., [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/))
- Project **communication next to code & data** (e.g., [Issues](https://github.com/features/issues))

::: {.notes}
- In science, we try to generate knowledge about the world
- For the sake of insight or explanation but also to perform evidence-based interventions
- Problem: We need to integrate our work with the work of other people into a common body of knowledge
- Process of continuous integration
- It's fair to say that the way that this is done in science is fairly chaotic
- Other disciplines with a analogous problem have professionalized the process of continuos integration
- primary anology: software development
- why? a lot of contemporary science involves digital research data and involves software development (or code) to analyze these data (or perhaps disciplines could really benefit from this)
- this might be shocking to some (you want to study the brain but now you need to code) but this is the way it is
- software development is a standard part of being a scientist
- we have to understand the tools that we use to do our job
- software development has a lot of tools that allow to handle continous integration professionally
- **distributed** and **asynchronous** work in large, international teams
- main work includes working with **data** using **code**
- when you train as a software developer, you learn a common stack of tools
- Testing: writing code to test if code works

## What is version control?

::: {.fragment}
*"Version control is a systematic approach to record changes made in a [...] set of files, over time. This allows you and your collaborators to track the history, see what changed, and recall specific versions later [...]"* ([Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs.html))
:::

::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
{{< fa laptop-code >}} keep track of changes in a directory (a "repository")

{{< fa code-commit >}} take snapshots ("commits") of your repo at any time

{{< fa timeline >}} know the history: what was changed when by whom

{{< fa code-compare >}} compare commits and go back to any previous state

{{< fa code-pull-request >}} work on parallel "branches" & flexibly "merge" them

## More benefits of Git(Hub) for project management

- {{< fa bug >}} Discuss and plan your project in [issues](https://github.com/features/issues) (even just with your future / past self)
- {{< fa comments >}}  Ask questions, share ideas and discuss with your community via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/features/discussions)
- {{< fa code-pull-request >}} Propose changes to each other's projects using [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) ^[*pull* requests on GitHub, *merge* requests on GitLab]
- {{< fa code-fork >}} Create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of someone else's repository and extend their work
- {{< fa key >}} Manage access to your projects with detailed [permissions and roles](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html)
- {{< fa book-medical >}} Add documentation to your repository or in a separate [wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis)
- {{< fa graduation-cap >}} Access to more features and tools for teaching via [GitHub Campus Global](https://education.github.com/)

::: {.fragment}
**Note**

- {{< fa brands github >}} The dominance of GitHub (a for-profit company owned by Microsoft) is not uncontested (see [#GiveUpGitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/))
- {{< fa boxes-packing >}} A project on GitHub is not a FAIR archiving of scholarly outputs (see previous and following slides)
:::

::: {.notes}
- GitHub Copilot is a for-profit AI product trained with projects that were hosted on GitHub, including many that have licenses that require proper author attribution etc.
- GitHub has a for-profit software services contract with the USA Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
- Archiving on GitHub is not enough
